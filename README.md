This mini project was a quiz for my python course in University. For this project I used web 
parsing on an online film camera store: https://filmcamerastore.co.uk/ to get prices, descriptions
and pictures of the items sold into a csv file. There are two codes in the file: one is for the items 
in stock and another for the ones not in stock, you could always comment one and run the code that way.

The provided code takes the first 5 pages of the sites latest arrived products and sorts them into a 
csv file. The information it gets is: price of the item, description of the item  and a link of the 
item image. you could adjust to run it on more or less pages by changing the range as well. The information
is asked for in between 12 - 15 seconds, just so the
site is not suspicious of codes behaivour.
